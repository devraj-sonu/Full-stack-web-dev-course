<!-- Semantic markup (often called semantic HTML) means using HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning of the content, not just how it looks.

👉 In simple words:
Semantic markup tells both the browser and developers what the content is.

🔹 What “semantic” means

Semantic = meaningful

So, semantic markup = meaningful HTML structure -->
